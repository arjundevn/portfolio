        <h3>Centralized Network:</h3>
        <p>A centralized network is where all the nodes or participants in a network
            connect to a single central authority for all the transactions between them. This central party acts
            as the source of truth and provides the necessary validation and trust in the network. Centralized
            systems are systems that use client/server architecture where one or more client nodes are directly
            connected to a central server. This is the most commonly used type of system in many organisations
            where client sends a request to a company server and receives the response. Wikipedia. Consider
            a massive server to which we send our requests and the server responds with the article that we
            requested. Suppose we enter the search term ‘junk food’ in the Wikipedia search bar. This search
            term is sent as a request to the Wikipedia servers (mostly located in Virginia, U.S.A) which then
            responds back with the articles based on relevance.
            While it is easy to build and maintain a centralized network, it has its disadvantages as below:
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Single Point of Failure:</strong>Failure: Since all the data is stored in a central server in a centralized network,
                it is very vulnerable to hacking. If a hacker attacks the central authority, the entire network is
                compromised.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Single Point of Authority:</strong>Authority: The central authority has all the control over the participant nodes
            in the network. Any decision that is being taken by the central authority has to be followed by
            the following nodes and hence the complete authority of the network lies in one particular
            party.</p></li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3>Distributed Network:</h3>
        <p>In a distributed network, each node is independent and
            interconnected with each other as shown in the figure above. Data is stored as copies
            in multiple systems or nodes and they communicate with each other. However, the
            authority still remains with a central party as in a centralized network. For example, in a
            CDN based application, copies of data is stored in multiple servers across the world and
            request responses are served from the nearest node.</p>
        <h3>Decentralized Network:</h3>
        <p>In decentralized systems, every node makes its own decision.
            The final behavior of the system is the aggregate of the decisions of the individual nodes.
            Note that there is no single entity that receives and responds to the request. Bitcoin and
            Torrents for example are decentralized in nature.
            Difference between distributed and decentralized network: Though distributed and
            decentralized systems look similar in architecture, the only thing that differentiates
            them is the authority. In a distributed system, there is a single authority that decides
            what happens in the network whereas, in a decentralized network, decisions are taken
            by each node individually and final decision is based on consensus among nodes.</p>
