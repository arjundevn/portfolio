        <h1>Blog #1: What is Blockchain?</h1>
        <small>29th sept 2021</small>
    </div>

    <div class='blog'>
        <p>Blockchain is a new technology wave that has already started revolutionizing and disrupting
            business, social and political interactions. It started in 2008 when an anonymous identity called
            Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin as a “Peer to Peer Electronic Cash system”.</p>
        <p>Traditional banking or other centralized systems have a central authority and all the users of that
            application trust that central authority for all the transactions and storage of data. In contrast,
            Blockchain applications eliminate the need for these third party central authorities. Trust is
            provided by the technology through the use of decentralization, distribution and consensus
            based algorithms.</p>
        <h3>Definition:</h3>
        <p>A data structure of blocks that are connected together to create a collection of records
            known as a “Digital Ledger”. Blockchain is a Decentralized and Distributed database that holds
            transactions in the form of blocks.</p>
        <h3>Representation of blockchain:</h3>
        <p>A blockchain is a collection of blocks chained to each other using cryptographic
            methods (Hashing) as shown below. The blocks contain transactions that happen in
            the network.</p>
        <h3>Features of Blockchain:</h3>
        <p>Blockchain is a disruptive technology and changing the way businesses operate around
            the world due to the below features
            <ul>
                <li>Tamper-resistance</li>
                <li>Decentralized network</li>
                <li>Security</li>
                <li>Distributed ledger</li>
                <li>Consensus based</li>
                <li>Faster settlement</li>
                <li>Globally accepted</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Industries which can leverage blockchain technology:</h3>
        <p>Blockchain is a secure way of storing data and because of all the above features of
            blockchain, many industries are adopting blockchain to increase the efficiency of their
            operations and to eliminate third party intermediaries. Some of the few industries
            where blockchain is being used are:
        <ul>
            <li>Banking</li>
            <li>Real Estate</li>
            <li>Voting</li>
            <li>Healthcare</li>
            <li>Supply Chain</li>
        </ul></p>
